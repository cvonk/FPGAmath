Implementations for the math operations introduced in [Building Math Circuits](https://coertvonk.com/category/hw/building-math-circuits). The circuits are built from the ground up using combinational described in HDL Verilog.

## A faster adder

Implements a Carry-lookahead Adder using circuits of logic gates Written in Verilog HDL for Altera FPGAâ€™s.
