The article <a href=https://coertvonk.com/category/hw/building-math-circuits">Building Math Circuits</a> describes how elementary math operations, such as addition/subtraction, multiplication/division and square root, can be done using logic circuits.

The repository contains HTML simulations used in the article, as well as Verilog HDL implementations of

  - Adder
      - ripple carry
      - Look ahead
      - Look ahead with 2 levels
  - Subtractor
      - Ripple borrow
  - Multiplier
      - array
      - carry save
  - Divider
       - attempt subtraction

But what good are fast math circuits, if you canâ€™t show them off? We decided to make a test setup to both demonstrate and verify the implementation of the circuits.

In the demo, an Arduino reads the operands from rotary encoders and shows them on 7-segment displays. It sends the operands along with the desired operation to the FPGA. That then returns the result to the Arduino, that shows it on the OLED screen.
