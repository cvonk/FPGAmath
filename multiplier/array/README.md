Implementations for the math operations introduced in [Building Math Circuits](https://coertvonk.com/category/hw/building-math-circuits). The circuits are built from the ground up using combinational described in HDL Verilog.

## Multiplier

Implements a Carry-propagate Array Multiplier using circuits of logic gates. Written in parameterized Verilog HDL for Altera and Xilinx FPGAâ€™s.
